I m **Krishna** a developer & builder from India.

I don’t just learn tech — I use it to build things that exist only in my head first and then in the real world.

If an idea hits me chances are I will turn it into a project.  
Maybe I will break it 7 times along the way but it ships eventually.

My current tech stack is **Python JavaScript Node.JS Express.JS MySQL and DOM-based frontend**.  
I also use **VS Code Postman and Git/GitHub** for most of my workflow.

I have built multiple small and medium-sized projects but the one I m proud of right now is my **backend ecommerce setup with full database integration**.

Public repos are growing. Private ideas are growing faster.

If you want to see how Im leveling up well… just stick around.
