### Hey there! 👋

I’m **Krishna**, a developer & builder from India.

I don’t just learn tech — I use it to build things that exist only in my head first, and then in the real world.

If an idea hits me, chances are I’ll turn it into a project.  
Maybe I’ll break it 7 times along the way, but it ships eventually.

My current tech stack is **Python, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, MySQL, and DOM-based frontend**.  
I also use **VS Code, Postman, and Git/GitHub** for most of my workflow.

I’ve built multiple small and medium-sized projects, but the one I’m proud of right now is my **backend ecommerce setup with full database integration**.

Public repos are growing. Private ideas are growing faster.

If you want to see how I’m leveling up, well… just stick around.
